<p>In its perennial struggle for relevance since the end of the nineteenth century, the CofE’s latest attempt is a study of &quot;excarnation&quot;. Its latest attempt is its joining of the panic about the internet. “Could technology become God?” asked Anne Richards. The CofE’s “National Adviser on New Religious Movements and Alternative Spiritualities”’s latest project is on “Excarnation”, described in an Intranet notice as “living life through ‘smart’ devices and social media. It is perhaps ironic that the institution which once fought for a vernacularisation which would make God a book for many millions more is now worried about digitisation.</p>
<p>Richards wondered if there was a distinction between the obtaining of information from online and digital sources. Perhaps, she suggested, we might become &quot;deskilled&quot; - unable to remember even our own names. There is a certain humour to the suggestion that writing information down that one does not need to memorise all the data one might refer to could inhibit intellectual development. In a coincidence, it appears that the school under a minute away happened to be that which was selected for her research.</p>
