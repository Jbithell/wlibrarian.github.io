<h1 id="lecture-notes-supplementary-issue-2">Lecture notes, Supplementary Issue 2</h1>

<p>This issue’s lecture reviews were written by Isky Mathews, Ms. Stone and the Editor.</p>
<h2 id="middle-east-society---the-great-war-and-its-consequences">Middle East Society - The Great War and its consequences</h2>
<p><strong>Professor Ali Ansari, Director of the Institute for Iranian Studies at the University of St Andrew’s</strong></p>
<h3 id="historic-context">Historical context</h3>
<p>Before World War I, there were two main imperial bodies in the region known as the Middle East: Persia and the Ottoman Empire. World War I led to Ottoman breakup. This was an especially important formative period for the Middle East. One should always be sceptical of coverage of the Middle East: Sykes-Picot, ever-present, never saw their plan fully implemented - nor did anyone else. Russia’s importance in the region has often been underestimated; it has historically had significant interests in the Middle East.</p>
<h3 id="the-iraq-war">The Iraq War</h3>
<p>2001 and 2003 disturbed this post-Great War settlement. The Americans attempted and somewhat managed to reshape the region in their own image. A particularly salient feature is the innovation of attempting to spread democracy. Ideally, this would allow a quick turnover; it turned out to lead to a significant loss of stability.</p>
<h3 id="obama">Obama</h3>
<p>Obama’s legacy is important. All Presidents attempt to make up for their predecessor’s failings. In this case, post-Bush exhaustion led to a perhaps premature withdrawal from the region. The second main feature of his rule was a (very) partial attempt to move a little closer to the pre-1979 situation where Iran was one of the main American partners in the region. A constructive relationship required a partner; this came not in the form of Ahmajinedad but Rouhani. The most significant step forward was nuclear. To some degree, this relationship is not based on material concerns but was emotional. It was hoped, especially by the Americans, that initial nuclear progress would lead to a broader rapprochement. This fits in, perhaps, to belief in Whig history, that is, history whose moral curve is long but bends towards justice. The pivotal moment may have been 2011/2012, where sanctions began to cripple the Iranian economy.</p>
<h3 id="modes-of-interaction">Modes of interaction</h3>
<p>There are two possible modes of interaction. The first involves the use of a thin end of the wedge, with the eventual aim of slotting the fat end of the wedge through too. The second involves having a strong base of initial progress upon which to build later, in a stable fashion. The former appears to have been employed under Obama.</p>
<p>Iranian thought values businessmen - Trump fit this description, so the Iranians thought they could make a deal. They were, however, not completely correct.</p>
<p>To Trump, the deal’s provisions are flawed in one crucial way - they are limited to a decade. The assumption that after ten years Iran will be sufficiently sound and integrated into the world economy is at best not entirely guaranteed. Another limitation of the agreement is that it has not been legally enshrined - it was pushed through by Presidential diktat, not legislative consent; just as the then-President gave, so too the current President may take away.</p>
<h3 id="who-to-trust">Who to trust?</h3>
<p>Professor Ansari concluded with an anecdote. An analyst, once, noticed that posters of President Obama had been plastered all over Iranian cities. He failed to notice that Obama was pictured next to Shemr - an ancient villain in Shi’ism.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How best can the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) be supported? The JCPOA makes political development contingent on economic development. A lack of Western investment in crucial industries has blunted its benefits to Iran. Crucially, access to dollar markets is lacking in Iran, curtailing investment and growth. These two concessions would lead to economic development and goodwill.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between the two methods of interaction previously described? Why must a first step necessarily be unstable? The Iranians decided to negotiate exclusively on nuclear issues. All further discussion was precluded. Had a grand bargain been struck, other issues may have been included; now that nuclear-related and sanctions-related issues have been somewhat solved, the Americans have fewer bargaining chips for later negotiations or negotiations on the opening of negotiations.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stipatores-honorati">Stipatores Honorati</h2>
<p>After a quick change of venue from the Refectory to Purcell’s common room (the tables and chairs had been cleared out of the Refectory ready for redecoration over Exeat), cake was served, tea was made and we all settled down to hear William speak on the history of apple cake. Norfolk apple buns had been set aside in favour of Dorset apple cake (the buns do not keep well and are also best made with almonds, which are obviously a banned substance) but nobody voiced any complaints and the quick disappearance of everyone’s cake spoke well of the quality - your correspondent, for one, thought it excellent.</p>
<p>William then led us on a quick whirl through various apple cakes from Dorset and Somerset, a West Country poem and the revelation that Norfolk apple buns are actually a surprisingly recent invention created by Pye Baker of Norfolk, finishing off with a reading about apples. Questions were then welcomed, including why do we so often see apple paired with cinnamon (no conclusion was drawn - perhaps a topic for further research) and what everyone’s favourite variety of apple was. Many different suggestions were made, with high scorers being Braeburns and Cox’s, but Asian apples had a late surge and one dissenting voice plumped for oranges instead.</p>
<p>A spirited debate then sprung up about the differences between muffins and cupcakes. Some members argued that they were the same thing, but others highlighted several differences including, but not limited to, the fact that the muffin escapes its case and the cupcake stays contained. The meeting then drew to a close with Colin the Caterpillar being accepted as the November cake, despite not being homemade.</p>
<h2 id="biology-bites">Biology bites</h2>
<p>This talk at Huxley Society was a rounding up of the science department’s “Biology Week”, consisting of multiple successive mini-presentations on different aspects of biological study.</p>
<p>The talk began with Hein Mante’s presentation on sharks. He firstly gave great detail on their evolutionary history:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>400 million years ago, the first cartilaginous fish have been observed to have evolved.</p></li>
<li><p>At 350 million years ago, shark scales were first formed in various pre-shark species. <strong>Placoid scales are, in fact, one of the distinctive features of sharks. They produce small-scale vortices around the sharks’ bodies which improve hydrodynamic efficiency and appear to have evolved from vertebrate teeth, as they contain a central pulp cavity supplied with blood vessels.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>320 million years ago, the first shark, <em>Cladselache</em>, was recognised. <strong>It should be noted that this makes sharks one of the oldest and most successful branch of fish.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Around 100 million years ago, a great explosion in shark species occurred for somewhat unknown reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>65-60 million years ago, the Great White and Megalodon sharks become distinct species.</p></li>
<li><p>1 million years ago, the last Megalodon specimen dies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>He then continued on to discuss their predatory behaviour and whether their “man-eating” reputation in public opinion is well-deserved. Hein mentioned that just 5 deaths per annum are caused by shark attacks, in comparison to Malaria’s 780,000/annum and AIDS’ 1,800,000/annum <strong>(or the 20 deaths per year caused by improper use of vending machines)</strong>. He observed that shark size affects predatory behaviour and that 2.3m appears to be a “critical length” beyond which sharks become significantly more aggressive, attempt to eat much larger prey than would normally be possible to swallow and also exhibit a much greater chance of trying to eat indigestible objects, such as pieces of coral, sponge or human waste.</p>
<p>Hein ended by considering sharks’ main predator, orcas. It was mentioned that they flip sharks upside-down using their tails - it appears this action causes a shark’s brain to flood with endorphins and as a result they become docile and motionless, even with the orca biting into them!</p>
<p>Mr. Moore’s presentation followed, beginning with an anecdote in which he had overheard some Upper School Westminsters declaiming Biology and those who took it along some remarks suggesting its inferiority to the other sciences. He jokingly expressed his unhappiness at this comment and said that Biology is often portrayed as a “Mickey Mouse” subject; he humorously concluded from this that the way to understand this remark is to examine the history of Mickey Mouse himself.</p>
<p>He noted how Mickey Mouse’s appearance and personality has changed significantly. No longer does Mickey Mouse smoke or steal or commit any sort of wrong-doing and he has gotten a larger cranium, eyes and exaggerated limbs. Mr. Moore explained that humans naturally find these features cute and pleasurable to look at - in fact, these features are found in nearly all baby animals and this is part of the reason most creatures have an urge to look after their young. Konrad Lorenz, the Nobel Prize winning biologist, was mentioned for his work in describing and categorising these precise physiological differences and follow up work by neuroscientist Stephen Hamann showed that the common responses to these features were involuntary amygdala responses, so nearly all are lying if they claim to not find such features attractive.</p>
<p>He described the phenomenon known as <em>neoteny</em>, where adults of a species retain features normally only found in juvenile specimens. He then pointed out that humans appear to have developed a form of neoteny, since adults of <em>Homo Sapiens</em> share many facial characteristics with young primates. <strong>It is believed that this was evolutionarily advantageous because having these attractive features probably made it more likely for a given “neotenic” individual to be helped by others.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Moore concluded that there is Biology in Mickey Mouse but the opposite is not true.</p>
<p>Brandon Tang then began his short presentation on cannibalism in nature by showing that it appears <strong>(perhaps oddly)</strong> often throughout the animal kingdom: pray mantis who eat their mates, tadpoles eating their siblings, hippos etc. He detailed a notable example in which a primate mother kept the body of her dead baby with her for at least a month, before proceeding to eat increasingly large portions of the body. He elaborated that this was not uncommon with primates; pack leaders have been seen to be eaten and families of primates have been seen to travel as a group eating other primates they encounter.</p>
<p>The traditional explanation for this was that in certain crowded areas of a forest, there may be great sexual competition and competition for food and that this leads in certain situations to primates killing others of their own kind, either out of some form of stress or necessitation.</p>
<p>Brandon said that he felt these explanations were inadequate as it doesn’t quite explain, for example, why direct relatives display a tendency to not attack each other but rather group together nor does it give any explanation for the situation of the mother carrying the dead baby as mentioned above. He gave a counter proposition: that this instead suggests such primates have a much higher level of complexity to their social behaviour than previously thought. He finished with the conjecture that perhaps their emotional intelligence has been underestimated and that they are quite capable of complex feelings towards others.</p>
<p>The final presentation was a talk on sloths and their peculiar habits by James Ferner. It was mentioned that in Costa Rica, there are two species of sloths: the three-toed and two-toed sloths. Along with the obvious difference in the number of claws they have on their hands, the two species have numerous physiological differences - this observation along with DNA samples have led to the hypothesis that the two species come from quite distinct branches of the tree of life. <strong>The two-toed sloth is believed to have been tree climbing for some million years but the three-toed sloth may have originated from the Giant Ground Sloth and become tree dwelling much more recently.</strong> If this was found to be true, James notes, then these sloths species would demonstrate one of the most striking examples of convergent evolution ever discovered.</p>
<p>Both species are folivores (leaf-eaters) with 4 stomachs and are extremely slow-moving. They come down once a month to go to the loo and this is when they are most vulnerable - they are predated on by snakes, harpy eagles and cougars. James then mentioned that their hair is so thick and curly that it is often seen green from the algae cultures that grow in it. They have developed, it seems, a form of symbiotic relationship with these plants, since the curls of the hair appear to exist to trap moisture which promotes algae growth, where the algae’s growth provides a form of camouflage in the foliage to sloths. This appears to make it more difficult for harpy eagles to find them in the canopy.</p>
<p>James ended the series of talks by mentioning their mating rituals, since he believed them to be quite humorous. It appears that females emit a high-pitch shriek from their tree to make it clear that they are ready to mate and then male sloths become much more active than normal, with some two-toed sloths seen swimming across lakes to get to the female. If multiple males arrive at roughly the same time, they can fight <strong>(quite slowly!)</strong> for dominance in mating.</p>
