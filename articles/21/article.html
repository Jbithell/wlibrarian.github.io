<h1 id="terror-and-colonialism-in-the-middle-east">Terror and colonialism in the Middle East</h1>

<p>If we were to choose one image to describe the last 15 years, what would it be? Perhaps it would be planes colliding with the Twin Towers, a bomb blast in the center of a Middle Eastern city or an ISIS flag hoisted above an armored car pounding across a desert road. Terrorism, or more specifically, Islamic terrorism, has entered the Western consciousness to a greater degree than ever before, and the consequent ‘debate’ has essentially consisted of trying to answer binary questions. Is Islam good or bad? Are Muslims inherently more prone to terrorism? Are terrorists ‘real Muslims’? Reducing our understanding of fundamentalism to these questions is unhelpful as not only is the issue too complex to answer with a simple yes or no, but seeking to pass blame onto either the Islamic faith or Muslims generally rather than actually consider the problem in any detail is unproductive. Instead, we could consider three things; the historical context for fundamentalism (a movement within Islam to return to its roots through theocratic government and religious conservatism), the reasons for the recent growth of terror and framing possible solutions to it in terms of its causes.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of fundamentalist groups is often boiled down to simply following Islamic texts literally and hating the West. The reality is that extremist groups deploy complex arguments for supporting them that rely on the anti-colonialist feeling that is widespread in the Middle East. The narrative which radical Islamist groups use is as follows; problems in the region are as a result of the legacy of colonial oppression, and coupled with historic political subjugation is the insidious influence of Western values such as tolerance of other religions and liberal attitudes in general. Following from this comes the assertion that imperialist oppression is not merely historic, but is in fact a part of the contemporary state of politics in the Muslim world, pointing to Western invasions and the influence of Western companies. As the influence of the West is so harmful and pervasive, then only radical action can remove it and the group in question, be that ISIS, Al-Qaeda or the Taliban has legitimacy and a prerogative to commit these acts. This argument is persuasive for a number of reasons. Firstly, it captures a constituency of Muslims who aren’t necessarily especially religious but are very opposed to Western influence in their countries. This may extend to more people being willing to co-operate with these groups or even fight for them. Secondly, this anti-colonialist rhetoric is powerful because at least the initial contention that Western imperialism systemically disadvantaged people in the Middle East is broadly true. This is embodied in historic oppression visited upon people by Western companies, such as the exploitation of Iran’s resources by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the more general long term transferal of wealth from the Middle East to the West. Further, there has been political subjugation not only by Westerners through agreements like Sykes-Picot which effectively divided up the Middle East between the French and the British, but also by secular ‘collaborators’ such as the Iranian Shah. It’s no coincidence that the 1979 Revolution in Iran preceded a growing public consciousness of fundamentalist ideology and represents the first major historical event driven by it. Finally, this rhetoric is so effective because by tapping into a fear of Western economic and political imperialism extremist groups weave into this a rejection of Western values. Overall, the anti-colonialist rhetoric which extremists use is nuanced and highly effective at persuading people to reject Western influence and values and to justify acts of extreme violence in order to prevent this influence in their countries. Within the West, this rhetoric has been potent at targeting disenchanted Muslim minorities such as Algerians in France as well us using social media to spread this message which taps into the resentment they feel to their home country, which is often a discriminatory environment for Muslims.</p>
<p>So aside from the historical context and how extremists persuade people to support or accept them, what is fuelling the current rise in fundamentalism? Broadly there are two reasons. The first is that the largest and most powerful countries in the Middle East have funded and promoted terrorist and extremist groups. This is true of Iran to a degree, funding as they do terrorist groups especially Palestinian separatist ones. By the far the bigger problem is Saudi Arabia’s influence on extremism. Money from Saudi has been funding Wahhabist movements for decades, and many groups that have direct links to the government and other actors within Saudi Arabia committed some of the worst terrorist attacks, including the 9/11 bombings. Why does the Saudi Arabian government do this? It comes down to what was referred to in the United States Senate as the &quot;deal with the devil&quot; that the Saudi government made; the Al-Saud family would be guaranteed control of the country as long as they went along with the agenda of religious leaders within Saudi Arabia. The effect of this is that both the government and religious groups within Saudi have provided funding and helped to train religious groups, promoting a fundamentalist narrative wherever is most vulnerable to their influence.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important to the increase in Middle Eastern terrorism than the influence of Islamic nations has been Western interventionism. When the fear of Western control casts such a long shadow, the repeated invasions by America and other Western actors vivifies the rhetoric of extremists and gives impetus to their cause. Even though the West has reduced its influence from the mid-2000s, now the methods involved such as tactical strikes and drone attacks cast an even longer shadow than soldiers did. This is the reason why ISIS chooses to livestream killing foreign journalists on the internet; they know that baiting the West into further warfare is likely to boost popular support. This has been proven before; multiple Western invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan drove people into the hands of terrorists there, and made the investment of Wahhabists from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere worthwhile. All the money that is invested in spreading fundamentalist ideologies is used much more efficiently at the point where what is happening around people mirrors what extremists have been saying about the West’s influence. Local clerics, imams and even secular community leaders are much more likely to mobilize with religious extremists when their countries are being invaded. What’s more, war drives desperation and despair, which aside from making people do things they otherwise wouldn’t also puts more power over peoples’ lives in the hands of terrorist groups. This is because in times of conflict public services like clean water, education and healthcare are scarce and often provided by terrorist groups rather than the government. This is a type of coercion on the part of the terrorist group, but the end result tends to be co-operation with the group which is maintaining their existence. A notable example of this is how Hamas is able to generate popular support partly because of how they are seen as positive contributors to Palestinian communities. Overall, investment and cultivation of Middle Eastern communities by various actors including Saudi Arabia and Iran combined with a pattern of Western military intervention in the Middle East has led to the rapid spread of and increase in terrorist groups and attacks.</p>
<p>Once we come to a more nuanced understanding of what drives fundamentalist ideologies in the Middle East we can start to frame possible solutions in terms of what causes it. The first of these is a massive reduction in Western military influence in the Middle East. When the stated aim a war is to ‘spread democracy’ that war can only help to spread extremism, because when death and destruction is fundamentally associated with the values that underpin the West we vindicate those who oppose these values. There are a number of criteria within which interventionism is sensible; when there is overriding support from Muslim countries, when there are clear and ‘closed’ strategic objectives and when it is obviously beneficial on a risk versus reward calculus for the region in which this intervention is taking place. Why select these particular criteria? Because on comparing the successful interventions which didn’t promote terrorism to a significant degree, such as in Somalia and Sierra Leone, against those that did such as the Second Gulf War these seem to be factors which are determinative in whether the long term legacy of any particular conflict is positive. A second possible solution is targeted economic aid in times of war. One of the problems that conflicts present is scarcity and desperation which is manipulated by extremists when they not only get to blame the West for all the horrors of war but also have greater control over peoples lives when they run hospitals and schools in conflict zones. If we can alleviate suffering in times of conflict it is probable that the reaction against the West will be less. Aside from the fact that simply making the situation better is strategically expedient, but it is simply more difficult to persuade people that the West are the imperialist conquerors who you must fight when it is obvious that Western governments and NGOs are making peoples lives better. Obviously Western charities do some work in areas of conflict now, but a large increase along with a less interventionist Middle Eastern policy seems advisable. What’s more, aid can be influence; if Western governments are funding schools in conflict zones, we can do good things like set up moderate madrassas rather than allow terrorists to set up extreme ones. It’s important to note here the distinction between or interventionism and aid – funding programs is unlikely to inspire the same visceral reaction in the Middle East given that Western governments wont have direct control and there will be long term benefits from more food and clean water to a better educated populace. A final step that could be taken are steps to prevent Saudi Arabian promotion of Wahhabist groups. Saudi’s continued stability is built on two things; American economic and military backing as well as oil and the influence it brings. It is inadvisable to demand Saudi Arabia unilaterally stop any relationship with Muslim extremists, not least because the religious leaders and most of the people in their country support these groups. There are, however, a number of sensible steps we could take. These include compelling the Saudi government to allow the creation of moderate madrassas in Saudi and areas of the Middle East which they influence – peace in the Middle East will be exceedingly difficult to achieve without moderating the views of people in Saudi Arabia. Secondly, compel Saudi to provide intelligence in secret of radicals within Saudi Arabia and their international actions. If we can’t plausibly prevent the existence of Saudi extremists, we can at least mitigate the harm they do.</p>
<p>Terrorism in the Middle East is a complex issue and isn’t just a modern problem but one which is firmly linked to historic traumas and the scars which that has left. It is, however, more recent developments which have promoted the cause of extremists, and the best way to reverse these changes to consider solutions as responses to what fuelled the present rise of fundamentalism.</p>
