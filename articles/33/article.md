The Library now sells both white and red poppies. The Chair, Jonny
Heywood, noted that “the library primarily exists to increase choice and
availability - choice and availability of books, newspapers and other
media. Something’s being provided does not, of course, imply
endorsement. To that end, both white and red poppies are now available
in the library.”

The Peace Pledge Union, who manufacture white poppies, say that “they
represent remembrance for all victims of war, a commitment to peace and
a challenge to attempts to glamorise or celebrate war.”

The British Legion writes that “The Legion advocates a specific type of
Remembrance connected to the British Armed Forces, those who were
killed, those who fought with them and alongside them.” It writes of
white poppies that it “see[s]</span> no conflict in
wearing the red poppy alongside the white poppy.”

The Library Committee’s Krispy Kreme sale was extremely successful -
over a dozen boxes were sold in under fifteen minutes.
